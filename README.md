## This program takes a file as command-line parameter and checks to see if there are any syntax errors for missing (), {}, or []. It will ask the user for another file if the previous file has no errors.


## If File is not created, it will create a file for you and assume the file is "empty" so the syntax would be "correct"

## Comments with // will ignore the entire line and works, but '(', '{', '[', would not work in this instance and would compile and "error" even though in reality it would "compile". '(' and others could be implemented into this assignment, but we are assuming that the files also do not have '(', '{', '[' or "(", etc in the file.
